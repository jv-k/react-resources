# Keeping up with React ðŸ’¡
This is a place to keep a collection of resources, tutorials, podcasts, documentation, and links to useful libraries that can help in the agile and constantly changing React ecosystem. I've used the list of resources given at the end of the UI Development With React course from EPFL Extension School as a springboard ðŸš€.
